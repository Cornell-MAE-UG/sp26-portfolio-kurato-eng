# Nutcracker Design

## Objective ("Find")
To design a hand-operated lever-style nut cracker capable of cracking a macadamia nut. Specifically, find the necessary geometry of the nutcracker such that an average An 
adult applying a normal grip force is capable of generating sufficient force at the nut to crack it. 

## Constraints ("Given")
- Macadamia nut diameter: 20mm
- Average adult grip force: 300N
- Force required to crack a macadamia nut: 2000N
- Tool Type: Lever-style nut cracker
- Assume the nutcracker is modeled as a simple rigid lever. Neglect friction and material deformation. The nut is assumed to be perfectly spherical and centered at the jaw.

## Approach
To crack the nut, the cracker must amplify the grip force by a sufficient mechanical advantage (MA). The lever geometry consists of the distance from the pivot to where 
the hand grips and the distance from the pivot to the nut. Using the input and output forces and the distance from the pivot to the nut, calculate the minimum distance 
from the pivot to the hand grips.

## Usability Discussion
The designed nutcracker achieves a mechanical advantage of 6.8, producing 2040N at the jaw. This just exceeds the 2000N required to crack the nut. The required effort arm 
For exactly 6.67 MA is 167mm, so the 170mm handle length provides a small but meaningful safety margin, meaning an average adult applying 300N of grip force is sufficient 
to crack the nut.

The 170mm handle length is comfortable and familiar, closely matching commercially available nutcrackers. Key limitations include no accommodation for users with weaker
grip strength, harder nuts to crack, and requiring higher cracking forces that may exceed the tool's capability at average grip strength. Additionally, there was no analysis 
on how much load the nutcracker is capable of withstanding. Too much load from the grip or from the nutcracker onto the nutcracker may cause permanent damage, leading to failure.
